Motivation

I've quite a number of existing setups and no single one results in exactly
what I'm after; that said, I don't expect what I do here to be different for
you, gentle reader.

I'm going to start with a lot of the ideas from,

http://www.enigmacurry.com/2008/05/09/emacs-as-a-powerful-python-ide/
and,
http://pedrokroger.net/2010/07/configuring-emacs-as-a-python-ide-2/

from there I'll slim them down to some minimal set.

Also, the Emacs Wiki has a lot of good ideas I'd like to capture on different
branches as "flavors", if you like.

Major Mode

http://www.loveshack.ukfsn.org/emacs/#python.el
http://www.loveshack.ukfsn.org/emacs/python.el
	Major mode for editing Python code. (A version of this is included in
	Emacs 22, but has assorted problems this one doesn't. It assumes
	sym-comp.el is loaded and requires emacs.py in Emacs' etc directory, i.e.
	data-directory.) This works better than the mode distributed with Python,
	but requires Emacs 22. See python-21.el for use with Emacs 21. Recent
	changes are listed in NEWS.python. 

http://www.loveshack.ukfsn.org/emacs/emacs.py
    Auxiliary file for use with python.el.
	Abstraction of the tags mechanism
	    Patch for Emacs 22 Etags that provides hooks for language modes to use
		their own mechanisms for navigating to definitions with M-.

http://www.loveshack.ukfsn.org/emacs/sym-comp.el
	Abstraction of mode-dependent symbol completion.
